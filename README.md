# AFSK Modem-2
 FX429 based AFSK Modem, using Arduino

This is a template. Not fully tested. Not every function is supported.
I am not going to share my own applications for now. If I add a low level function I may share them in the future.

It decodes MPT1327 data successfully, not sure about MDC1200. Since I am not interested much, I didn't spend much time.
If you are interested in, fork my repo. 

All rights reserved. Only amateur radio use is allowed. You cannot sell/make profit, include into commercial project without written consent.
If you use this somehow, It has to be a public fork of this repo.
Do not try to make stupid/illegal things. Do not transmit into used trunk radio channels.
